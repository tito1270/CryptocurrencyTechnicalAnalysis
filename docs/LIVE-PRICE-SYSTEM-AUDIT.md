## Technical Improvements

### API Architecture
1. **Primary Sources:** Direct exchange APIs (Binance, OKX, Coinbase, KuCoin, Bybit)
2. **Secondary Source:** CoinGecko API for additional coverage
3. **Fallback Layer:** Current market-based prices (January 2025)
3. **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with informative logging
4. **Performance:** Parallel API requests with 5-second timeouts

### Price Data Structure
```typescript
interface PriceData {
  broker: string;           // Exchange identifier
  pair: string;            // Trading pair (e.g., "BTC/USDT")
  price: number;           // Current live price
  change24h: number;       // 24-hour percentage change
  volume: number;          // 24-hour trading volume
  high24h: number;         // 24-hour high
  low24h: number;          // 24-hour low
  timestamp: number;       // LIVE API timestamp
}
```

### Data Sources Verification
- **LIVE APIs:** Direct exchange API connections (Binance, OKX, Coinbase, KuCoin, Bybit)
- **Real-time Data:** Live price feeds with 30-second refresh
